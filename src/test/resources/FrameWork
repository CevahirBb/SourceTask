SauceDemoTask: I designed the framework to fulfill the task requirements efficiently.
Initially, I crafted scenario and corresponding step definitions, ensuring alignment with the specified test cases.
To enhance maintainability and reusability, I implemented the Singleton Pattern, creating LoginPage, ProductPage, CartPage, and CheckoutPage.
These pages dynamically locate relevant elements and offer dynamic methods for seamless integration into various test cases.
This approach simplifies test development
and promotes code efficiency.
